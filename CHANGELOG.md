# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

- Adding test routines to verify the correct summary of received data
  - Added `?createData=1` test that writes triples of { seq, sentAt, receivedAt} to a CSV file when collection stops and downloads it as _cutie-results-yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm.csv_.
  - Added `injectLatencyInfo()` function that takes an array of triples and injects them into the chart just as if they had been received "in real time"
  - Added `getLatencyMonitorStats()` that retrieves `{ MOSQuality, PacketLoss, Latency, Jitter }` with arrays of four values that mirror those in the Latency Monitor.

- Set fixed-width fields for ms values in Latency Monitor panel
- Add new API `/api/beacon` that is triggered when the client changes, shows/hides, etc.
  the Cutie tab; triggered by _lifecycle-beacon.ts_
- More documentation/comments for `api/webrtc`
- Slightly tuned up _deploy.sh_ script
- Bump version to 0.2.10

---

## Version 0.2.9 - 2025-12-03

- Improve _deploy.sh_. It now removes all but the 10
  most recent log files from _logs/_,
  checks and kills previous Cutie instances, and
  logs all the steps of the install/build process.

## Version 0.2.8 - 2025-12-02

- Updated `api/stats` to display ConnectionID,
  connection start time and duration
- Also display the 10 most recent ConnectionIDs
  with their stats to see how they perform

## Version 0.2.7 - 2025-12-02

- Update _deploy.sh_ to run `npm run preview`
  (instead of `npm run dev` on the remote host)
- Deploy script forces port 5173 for stability for other testers
- Fixed link to Provenence in _Theory of Operation_
- Added a couple test cases to _To Do_

## Version 0.2.6 - 2025-11-21

- Add `/api/stats` to return runtime stats
- Added `beforeUnload` listener to drop connection before browser window closes/reloads
- Factor _+page.svelte_ to move all the WebRTC functions to _webrtc.ts_
- Server startup message includes LOG_LEVEL
- Add _deploy.sh_ script to deploy the app on the production host
- Fix lint errors in _NetworkHistoryChart.svelte_
- Much more logging (using `logger`) to understand loss of connection or possible OOM
- Switched to `@sveltejs/adapter-node` to make `npm run preview` run on production host
- Moved Blueberry Hill Software _favicon.ico_ to _/static_
- Bump version to 0.2.6 (skipped 0.2.5)

## Version 0.2.4 - 2025-11-03

- Align left edges of all three charts
  so time stamps all line up vertically.
- Make all labels for the axes bold
- Move startup/logging code to hooks.server.ts
- Bump version to 0.2.4

## Version 0.2.3 - 2025-11-03

- Bump to version 0.2.3 (Version 0.2.2 not released)
- Even more logging to detect interesting HTTP and WebRTC events
- Editorial pass on To-Do.md and home page (add link to Github repo)
- Add MIT License, with a note that Cutie also includes
  a PRO Personal license to UAParser.js
- Switch date display from UTC to locale

## Version 0.2.1 - 2025-10-27

- Added logging on server to detect failing WebRTC

## Version 0.2.0 - 2025-10-26

- Changed name to Cutie Network Quality Test ("QT" - get it?)
- Factored out the "chart code" so that it lives in one file
- Pin chart points to the max of the chart;
  tooltip shows the correct value
- Change Statistics panel to show:
  Start time, Elapsed Time, Bytes Transferred, Bytes/second, Round Trip Time
- Display the ConnectionID in the
  Server object message at the bottom
- Bump version to 0.2.0

## Version 0.1.0 - 2025-10-17

- Created charts for all variables:
  MOS, Packet Loss, and Latency&Jitter
- mosStore.ts saves all four statistics in
  one time-stamped object
- Moved all charts into a single panel
- Fixed the MOS chart to run from
  1.0 (Bad) to 4.5 (Excellent)
- Fixed all the `npm run check` and
  `npm run lint` errors
- _Dockerfile still does not work_
- This is good enough to criticize...

## Version 0.0.4 - 2025-10-17

- Adjust chart to preserve starting time at the origin

## Version 0.0.3 - 2025-10-17

- Better charts: fixed time stamps
- Chart test routine: add `?chartTest=1` to the URL
- Runs for max of two hours, then auto-stops
- Fixed delay of connection for Firefox
  (returns first ICE instead of waiting for all to arrive
  or timing out after 15 seconds)
- Created new README; moved old to DEVELOPMENT.md
- Created this CHANGELOG
- Bump version to 0.0.3

## Version 0.0.2 - 2025-10-16

- Basic functionality:
- Start an RTC connection to local backend server
  and send Latency Probes
  containing a sequence number and current time
  every 100 msec (10 probes/second).
- RTC Server echoes back the latency probes
- The client can use those returned latency probes
  to summarize latency, jitter, and packet loss both
  instantaneous and "averaged over the last 10 seconds"
- Those "10-second" values are charted.
  The first chart is MOS Quality
  (which is pretty boring on my local network) because
  it's low latency and jitter and near zero packet loss
- Two more charts to come: a packet loss chart,
  and latency/jitter both in the same chart
  All three charts will be slaved to the same time scale.
- Runs only for two hours, then auto-stops
- Also stops after clicking Stop, or an error occurs,
  such as no latency probes for a while.
- Much diagnostic/troubleshooting/test GUI elements remain
